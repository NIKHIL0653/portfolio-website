# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js has revolutionized the way we build React applications. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamental concepts and get you started with building modern web applications.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create web applications. By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

## Key Features

### 1. **File-based Routing**
Next.js uses a file-system based router built on the concept of pages. When a file is added to the pages directory, it's automatically available as a route.

### 2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
With SSR, the HTML of the page is generated on the server for each request. This improves performance and SEO.

### 3. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
Next.js can pre-render pages at build time, creating static HTML files that can be cached and served from a CDN.

### 4. **API Routes**
Next.js allows you to create API endpoints as Node.js functions, enabling you to build full-stack applications.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Create a new Next.js app
npx create-next-app@latest my-app

# Navigate to the project
cd my-app

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

```
my-app/
├── pages/
│   ├── api/
│   ├── _app.js
│   └── index.js
├── public/
├── styles/
├── package.json
└── next.config.js
```

## Your First Page

Creating a new page is as simple as adding a new file to the `pages` directory:

```jsx
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>This is the about page</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Data Fetching

Next.js provides several methods for fetching data:

### getStaticProps (SSG)
```jsx
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const posts = await data.json()

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}
```

### getServerSideProps (SSR)
```jsx
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const posts = await data.json()

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}
```

## Styling Options

Next.js supports various styling approaches:

1. **CSS Modules** - Scoped CSS
2. **Styled-jsx** - Built-in CSS-in-JS
3. **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first framework
4. **Sass** - CSS preprocessor

## Deployment

Deploying a Next.js app is straightforward with Vercel:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

## Best Practices

- **Use TypeScript** for better development experience
- **Optimize images** with next/image component
- **Implement proper SEO** with next/head
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Enable performance monitoring**

## Conclusion

Next.js provides an excellent foundation for building React applications with built-in optimizations and developer experience improvements. Whether you're building a simple website or a complex web application, Next.js has the tools and features to help you succeed.
